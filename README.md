## Episode 1

[![Watch the video](/Part_1/ep1.jpg)](https://youtu.be/c6mrcNEFBoA?si=2KJQS0jbuTS4Maua)

#### Hardware 
- [x] Connect two 9g rotors and the potentiometers to the Arduino board to control movement

### Robot structure
- [x] First prototypes attemp for arms (carton, small lego + scotch tape)

#### Software
- [x] Simple control for the motors through potentiometers (each potentionmeter controls one motor in real time)

## Episode 2

#### Hardware

- [ ] Add a battery for more power - figure out needed voltage, resistors, power distribution, etc
- [ ] Add some buttons for different saved positions (pre-configure angle values for each potentiometer to define a position)
- [ ] Try heavier rotors (15kg, 20kg)


#### Robot structure
- [ ] More prototyping for arms with plastic, LEGO, other
- [ ] Better "arm" structure and interconnection - with three motors standing on table and all supported / able to stand and move

#### Software
- [ ] Make some functions for assigning a fixed position and triggering this with a button 
- [ ] Refactor code with the Python module for Arduino


## Episode 3
#### Hardware

#### Robot structure
- [ ] Connect to the lamp (two degrees of movement and screwed into the table) for a more robust build so we can focus on software. Connect servomotors to lamp "joints"

#### Software 
- [ ] Work on the detection model to find my face/hand sign 
- [ ] Function to trigger one of the pre-degined positions based on the detected gesture (rather than through the button press)

## Episode 4
#### Hardware 
#### Robot Structure
- [ ] Something 3D printed 

#### Software
- [ ] Following real time dynamic moves based on the image detection - have the lamp follow me around in real time to point the light at me - determine which rotors to move 


## Episode 5
- [ ] lerobot with the built-in detection modules?
- [ ] Compare / what I’ve learned / what I would do different / etc
