## Episode 1

[![Watch the video](/Part_1/ep1.jpg)](https://youtu.be/c6mrcNEFBoA?si=2KJQS0jbuTS4Maua)

#### Hardware 
- [x] Connect two 9g rotors and the potentiometers to the Arduino board to control movement

### Robot structure
- [x] First prototypes attemp for arms (carton, small lego + scotch tape)

#### Software
- [x] Simple control for the motors through potentiometers (each potentionmeter controls one motor in real time)

## Episode 2

[![Watch the video](/Part_2/ep2thumb.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB-Buinw3lE&)


#### Hardware

- [x] Add some buttons for different saved positions (pre-configure angle values for each potentiometer to define a position)



#### Robot structure
- [X] More prototyping for arms with plastic, LEGO, other
- [X] Better "arm" structure and interconnection - with ~three~ two motors standing on table and all supported / able to stand and move

#### Software
- [X] Make some functions for assigning a fixed position and triggering this with a button 
- [ ] ~~Refactor code with the Python module for Arduino~~ (Arduino Uno does not support micropython - try this with a future board!)


## Episode 3
#### Hardware
- [ ] Add a battery for more power - figure out needed voltage, resistors, power distribution, etc
- [ ] Try heavier rotors (15kg, 20kg)

#### Robot structure
- [ ] Connect to the lamp (two degrees of movement and screwed into the table) for a more robust build so we can focus on software. Connect servomotors to lamp "joints"

#### Software 
- [ ] Work on the detection model to find my face/hand sign 
- [ ] Function to trigger one of the pre-degined positions based on the detected gesture (rather than through the button press)

## Episode 4
#### Hardware 
#### Robot Structure
- [ ] Something 3D printed 

#### Software
- [ ] Following real time dynamic moves based on the image detection - have the lamp follow me around in real time to point the light at me - determine which rotors to move 


## Episode 5
- [ ] lerobot with the built-in detection modules?
- [ ] Compare / what I’ve learned / what I would do different / etc
